# KingKiller Chronicle books sentiments analysis

This project is a reupload of a notebook that I [originally made on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vincentbonchaud/kingkillerchronicle-analysis/notebook).

This analysis first covers a text mining analysis, using word clouds, n-grams, and sentence/word counts.
In a second step it further analyzes the distribution of feelings and emotions.
